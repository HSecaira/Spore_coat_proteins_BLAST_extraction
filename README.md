# Spore_coat_proteins_BLAST_extraction

This repository contains Biopython scripts to extract significant pBLAST hits (i.e. proteins) using the protein id. These scripts were used as part of the project Diversity and Evolutionary Dynamics of Spore Coat Proteins on Bacillales and Bacillus. 

The scripts require Jupyter Notebook, Python and Biopython. Aditionally, you need a .xml file containing the local BLAST results and a genbank file containing the genome of the species you want to extract the genes.

  - Bacillus_extract_genes_scripts.ipynb
  - result_Bacillus_xiamenensis_VV3.xml (BLAST results)
  - cotE_aligned.fas
